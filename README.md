# implementation-of-postgres-master-slave-using-cdc-and-risingwave
This repository provides a practical implementation of a PostgreSQL master-slave replication setup using Change Data Capture (CDC) and RisingWave. It demonstrates how to configure logical replication between a master and slave PostgreSQL instance, and how to stream real-time changes into RisingWave for further processing.
